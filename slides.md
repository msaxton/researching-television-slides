## Getting started with your research

## JumboSearch, library catalog, libraries worldwide

* **JumboSearch** Searches the widest possible scope of Tisch Materials.
* **library catalog** Searches only books, audio visual media, and journals in the Tisch Library.

## Keywords and Subject terms

* Keywords are created by the user based on research interests.
    * Use to search title, author, table of contents, and summary (when available)

* BUT should I search for "television" or "tv"? "Children" or "kids"?

* Subject terms are created by librarians to reduce ambiguity. Less ambiguity means more precise searches.

* "Television", not "tv"
* "Children", not "kids"

Note: There is a subject term [Television and children](https://tufts-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?query=sub,exact,Television%20and%20children,AND&tab=tufts_alma&search_scope=TUFTS_ALMA&sortby=rank&vid=01TUN&lang=en_US&mode=advanced&offset=0)
